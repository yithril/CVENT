Instructions for Writing a Feature File for the BankAccount Class

1. Define the Feature

Start by describing what aspect of the BankAccount class you are testing. Use the Feature keyword to introduce it.

    Tip: Think about the main functionality or behavior of a bank account that you want to test.

2. Set Up the Background

Use the Background section to establish any common setup steps that will apply to all your scenarios.

    Tip: Consider what initial state you need for your bank account before each scenario runs. This often involves setting up a default or starting condition.

3. Write Scenarios

Define specific scenarios to test various operations. Each scenario should focus on a particular action and its expected result.

    Tip: Think about common actions you might perform with a bank account, such as depositing money or withdrawing money. Describe these actions and their outcomes clearly.

4. Use Scenario Outline for Multiple Examples

If you need to test different sets of data, use Scenario Outline with Examples.

    Tip: If you want to test multiple amounts of deposits and withdrawals, this is where you should use a scenario outline to provide different examples.

5. Combine All Elements

Put everything together in your feature file. Ensure each scenario is clear and follows the structure youâ€™ve defined.

    Tip: Double-check that your steps match the methods in your step definitions and that your scenarios cover all the functionalities you want to test.
