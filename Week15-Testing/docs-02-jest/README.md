# Unit 2: Jest

## Unit Overview

This unit provides a comprehensive introduction to Jest, a popular JavaScript testing framework. It covers everything from setting up and running tests to using matchers, managing setup and teardown, mocking functions, testing asynchronous code, and using snapshot testing. By the end of this unit, you will be equipped with the knowledge to write effective and efficient tests for your JavaScript applications.
