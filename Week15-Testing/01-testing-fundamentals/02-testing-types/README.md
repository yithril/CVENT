# Types of Testing

## Introduction

There are various types of software testing, each serving a different purpose and addressing different aspects of the software. Understanding these types helps in selecting the right approach for different testing needs.

## Unit Testing

Unit testing involves testing individual components or units of a software application to ensure they work correctly. Each unit is tested in isolation from the rest of the application.

```javascript
// Example of a simple unit test in JavaScript using Jest
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b
}

test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
  expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3)
})
```

## Integration Testing

Integration testing focuses on verifying that different modules or components of a software application work together as expected. It aims to identify issues that occur when modules are integrated.

```javascript
// Example of an integration test in JavaScript using Jest
const fetchData = require('./fetchData')
const processData = require('./processData')

test('fetches and processes data', async () => {
  const data = await fetchData()
  const result = processData(data)
  expect(result).toEqual(expectedResult)
})
```

## System Testing

System testing involves testing the complete and integrated software application to ensure it meets the specified requirements. It covers end-to-end testing of the entire system.

## Acceptance Testing

Acceptance testing is performed to determine whether the software meets the acceptance criteria and is ready for deployment. It is usually conducted by the end-users or clients.

## Conclusion

Different types of testing address different needs and aspects of the software. Understanding these types helps in planning and executing an effective testing strategy.
