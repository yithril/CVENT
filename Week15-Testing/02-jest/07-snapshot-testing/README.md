# Snapshot Testing in Jest

## Introduction

Snapshot testing is a powerful feature in Jest that allows you to capture the output of a function or the state of an object and compare it to future states to detect unexpected changes.

## Creating Snapshots

To create a snapshot, use the `toMatchSnapshot` method to capture and compare the output.

### Example: Testing a JavaScript Object

```javascript
const user = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  age: 30,
}

test('user snapshot', () => {
  expect(user).toMatchSnapshot()
})
```

## Updating Snapshots

If the output changes intentionally, you can update the snapshot by running Jest with the `-u` flag.

```bash
npm test -- -u
```

## Snapshot Best Practices

- **Keep snapshots readable**: Ensure that your snapshots are small and easy to understand.
- **Review snapshots**: Always review snapshots as part of your code review process.
- **Avoid excessive snapshots**: Only use snapshots for objects or outputs where it makes sense.

## Conclusion

Snapshot testing in Jest helps ensure that your code does not change unexpectedly. By capturing and comparing the output, you can detect unintended changes early.
