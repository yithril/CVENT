# Introduction to JUnit

## Introduction

JUnit is a widely-used testing framework for Java applications. It provides annotations to identify test methods, assertions to test conditions, and tools for running tests and reporting results. JUnit promotes the practice of writing repeatable and automated tests, which is a core aspect of Test-Driven Development (TDD).

## Key Features

- **Annotations**: Use annotations to identify test methods and control test execution.
- **Assertions**: Verify the expected outcomes using a rich set of assertion methods.
- **Test Runners**: Run tests and report results.
- **Integration**: Easily integrates with build tools like Maven and Gradle.

## Conclusion

JUnit is an essential tool for Java developers, making it easier to write, organize, and run automated tests. It helps ensure code quality and reliability by allowing developers to catch bugs early in the development process.
